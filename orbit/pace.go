// system queued, and drawing a frame for each of them asks for more work than
// there is time for.
//
// So a frame that would arrive before the last one has been paid for is not
// drawn. Nothing is lost by that here either — the turn it would have shown is
// still in the accumulators, and the next frame shows all of it — and what is
// left over when the pointer stops is drawn by a trailing timer.

// pace draws the waiting turn now if the last frame has been paid for, and
// otherwise leaves it for the timer.
