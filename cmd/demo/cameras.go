// camerasShow is four cameras on one scene as four widgets, with the glue that
// made them one figure written out here instead of inside the widget.
//
// One orbit widget with four views shares a selection by construction and turns
// its views apart unless orbit.Together says otherwise. Four widgets share
// nothing: each is a plot of its own, and everything that makes them one
// figure is a handler in this file — a pick ringed in all four, a turn that
// optionally turns all four, and the level-of-detail trade that keeps that
// affordable. That is the arrangement a program wants when the views live in
// different parts of a window, or when it wants to decide per view what links.
//
// # Keeping up
//
// With "turn together" on, a drag in one widget redraws all four on every
// frame, one after another on Fyne's goroutine. The one under the pointer is
// the one the reader is watching, so the others can be drawn at half
// resolution while the gesture lasts and sharpened when it ends:
// orbit.Detail(0.5) says how coarse, Chart.OnGesture says when, and
// Chart.SetCoarse does it. The status line shows the time a frame takes, so
// the difference can be read off rather than guessed at.
