// The interaction surfaces figure offers: an overlay layer to paint
// over a finished chart, layers a reader can turn off, and a view that can be
// read off one chart and put into another.
//
// All three are figure's, and none of them is wired by figure — a legend
// that always toggled, a crosshair nobody asked for and two charts that always
// moved together would each be wrong somewhere. What a widget adds is the
// wiring, the surface hold every redraw needs, and the repaint afterwards.

// overlays is the caller's overlay with the rubber band of a drag over it.
//
// Both are optional and either may be nil, which is why this exists rather
// than [figure.Overlays]: the chart wants one installed thing whose parts it
// can change without reinstalling it, and a slice would have to be rebuilt
// every time a drag started.

// caller then moves — a crosshair's position, a tooltip's text — so installing
// it once and writing to it from a [figure.Hover] handler is the intended
// shape:
