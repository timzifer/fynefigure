// Chart is a figure plot as a Fyne widget.
//
// It is drawn by [fynefigure.Target] and steered by [figure.Input], so what
// it shows is what the same plot would write to a file, and how it behaves is
// how the same plot behaves in a browser or a native window: hover to see what
// is under the pointer, drag to pan, turn the wheel to zoom about it, double
// click to go back to the whole picture.
//
// It behaves that way once it is [Interactive], and not before. Until then it
// takes no pointer events at all and is a picture that follows its size, its
// theme and its data.
//
// The chart is opened at the first layout, because a plot needs a size and a
// widget has none until it is laid out. Everything before that — adding
// layers, setting scales — belongs on the plot.
