// The pointer. Every handler hands the position to figure.Input and then asks
// for a frame; Live paints nothing when the frame is identical to the last, so
// a hover that found the same mark twice costs nothing.
//
// Both Hoverable and Draggable are implemented because Fyne splits the pointer
// between them: while a button is held on a draggable object, MouseMoved stops
// firing and Dragged fires instead. figure.Input wants one stream of
// positions and works out for itself whether it is a hover or a pan.
//
// None of it is the chart's own. The handlers belong to pointer, a layer laid
// over the raster that is hidden unless the chart was made [Interactive]. Fyne
// decides where an event goes by the interfaces an object implements, not by
// whether it wants the event, so a chart that were Scrollable itself would take
// the wheel from the scroll container around it even while ignoring every
// notch. A hidden layer is not found at all, and the event goes to whatever is
// behind it.

// pointer is the layer that takes the pointer for a chart.
