// Pacing is why a chart stays responsive under a drag.
//
// Fyne's desktop driver drains the whole operating-system event queue in one
// pass, so a pointer moving at a hundred events a second delivers a hundred of
// them — and each one that pans or zooms costs a frame, which on a chart of any
// size is tens of milliseconds. Drawing every one of them means asking for four
// times the work there is time for, and the backlog does not drain: the chart
// falls further behind the cursor for as long as the drag lasts.
//
// So a frame that would arrive before the last one has been paid for is not
// drawn. It is remembered instead, and the newest one wins — the reader is
// pointing somewhere now, and where they pointed two events ago is not
// interesting. What is left over is drawn by a trailing timer, so a drag that
// stops still ends up where it stopped.
//
// Nothing is lost by dropping a pan: figure's Input pans by the distance from
// the last position it was told about, so the next one it hears covers the
// whole way. Nothing is lost by dropping a zoom either, because the deltas are
// added up and applied together — a wheel factor is exp(delta/1000), and
// exp(a)*exp(b) is exp(a+b).

// doOnFyne puts work on Fyne's goroutine. It is the one place a timer crosses
// back, so it is the one place to look when that stops being true.
