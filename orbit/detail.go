// Detail is package chart's level-of-detail trade, made for the chart nobody is
// touching.
//
// Several orbit widgets side by side that a program links — a camera turned in
// one turning the others, say — draw every one of them on every frame of the
// gesture, one after another on Fyne's goroutine. The chart under the pointer
// is the one the reader is watching; the others are peripheral vision, and
// what they need is to keep up rather than to be sharp. So a program can have
// those drawn coarser than the screen while the gesture lasts
// ([Chart.SetCoarse]) and sharp again when it ends, and it learns when a
// gesture starts and ends from [Chart.OnGesture].
//
// It pays for the reason it does in package chart: the rasterizer's cost is per
// pixel, and Fyne stretches a smaller frame on the graphics card for nothing.
// Half the resolution is a quarter of the pixels.
//
// None of it is automatic, because which charts are "the others" is not the
// widget's to know — it does not know what it has been linked to.

// wheelSettles is how long after the last wheel notch a wheel gesture counts as
// over. A drag says when it ends; a wheel does not, so it is timed. It is
// package chart's number for the same question. It is a variable only so that
// a test on a slow runner can widen it: see export_test.go.

// Going coarse draws nothing new on screen: the frame showing stays until the
// next one, which is the one a camera moved for. Going sharp redraws at once,
// so that the chart a reader stops on is never left blurred.
