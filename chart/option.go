// Follow makes the named axes track the rows the chart currently holds instead
// of every row it has ever been shown. It applies to a chart with a
// [Chart.Stream] and to no other, and the default is the x axis alone, which
// is what a time series wants.
//
// Two things stand between a sliding window and an axis that follows it, and
// this handles both.
//
// A scale is *trained*, and training accumulates: a domain only ever grows,
// because that is what a chart of a fixed table wants — every render sees the
// same rows, and the axis must not depend on the order they arrived in. A
// window whose oldest row leaves on every frame is the other case, so a
// followed axis is released before each frame and established again from the
// rows that are there.
//
// And a linear axis *nices* by default: it rounds its domain outward to whole
// tick steps. That frames a still chart well and fights a moving one — the
// axis holds while the data slides under it, then jumps a tick and holds
// again, so the oldest samples visibly leave the chart before the axis admits
// they are gone. A followed axis is therefore rebuilt from its own description
// with that rounding off, once, keeping everything else about it. An axis
// pinned to a domain is left alone — a pinned domain is never niced — and so
// is one carrying a formatter, which a description cannot hold.
//
// The y axis is not followed by default: a live chart is far easier to read
// against a fixed scale, and pinning one with scale.Domain is the usual answer.
//
// Following stops the moment a reader zooms or pans — a view someone dragged
// into place is not something to take away from them — and starts again on the

// Detail sets how much of the screen's resolution a chart is drawn at while a
// reader is dragging or zooming it. The default is 1: full resolution, always.
//
// A rasterizer's work is per pixel; stretching a small picture over a large
// area is the graphics card's, and free. So a chart can be drawn coarser while
// a gesture is in flight and properly once it ends, and on the CPU rasterizer
// that is worth a great deal — 23 ms a frame becomes 7 ms at 0.5, which is the
// difference between twenty frames a second and fifty.
//
// It is off by default because it is visible: a chart being dragged is soft
// until it is let go, and that is a trade a reader should be offered rather
// than given. Reach for it when a chart is large, or the data heavy, or the
// machine slow — and note that the GPU tier in fynefigure/gpu makes the same
// frame cost 5 ms without softening anything, so try that first.
//
// Values outside (0, 1] mean the same as 1. A chart nobody is touching is

// FrameInterval sets how much time a frame is given to itself while a reader

//
// Input arrives far faster than a chart can be drawn — see pace.go — so a
// frame that would start before the last one has been paid for is held back
// and replaced by the next, and the newest one is drawn when the interval is
// up. The default, which is what a zero here means, is the last frame's own
// measured cost: a chart that draws in three milliseconds is not held to sixty
// a second, and one that takes fifty is not asked for more than twenty.
//
// Name one to pin the rate — 16ms for sixty a second on a chart that can keep
// up — or pass a negative duration to turn the pacing off and draw every event
// as it arrives, which is what a test that wants one frame per call does.

// FollowPause decides what happens when a reader drags or zooms a chart whose

// Off, the chart stays in charge: a pan or a zoom that would move a followed

// default for a sliding window, because there is nothing behind the tip to pan
// to — the rows that scrolled off were dropped, so a drag that took the view
// back would strand the reader in front of data that no longer exists while
// the live data marched off the other side.
//
// On, the reader takes over: the first pan or zoom pauses following, the view
// stays where they put it, and the double click that resets the view hands the
// chart back to the data. That is what a chart with history rather than a
// window wants — one whose source keeps everything it has been given.
//
// It has no effect on a chart that follows nothing, which is every chart

// FollowTheme makes the chart switch between figure's light and dark themes

// ThemeFont draws the chart's labels in the application's typeface, read from

// Fyne renders text through a shaper that falls back: a character its theme
// font has no glyph for is drawn from another font, so the label appears. That
// matters here because Fyne's own theme font is NotoSans-Regular, which has no
// glyph for U+2264, U+2265 or U+221E — a chart titled "30° ≤ x" and an axis
// labelled in ∞ reach for exactly those.
//
// So a chart drawn in the theme's typeface keeps the rasterizer's own fonts
// behind it, for the glyphs the theme's has not got: the symbol is drawn, in
// the face the same plot's exported PNG draws it in, and the metrics stay the
// theme font's so nothing moves. See [fynefigure.FallbackFont].
//
// What is left of the difference is the typeface itself. The default is the
// fonts every other figure raster uses, which is what makes a chart on screen
// comparable pixel for pixel with the PNG the same plot exports. Turn this on
// when matching the application's typeface matters more.

// DragMode sets what dragging the chart does: pan the view, drag out a

//
// The band a rubber-band drag paints is the chart's — figure draws nothing
// while one is being dragged out, because what the feedback should look like
// is the surface's business. See [Brush] for the look of it, and [Chart.Brush]

//
// What a selection *means* is the caller's. figure fires [figure.Select] on

// Brush sets what the rubber band of a [DragMode] drag looks like. Passing nil
